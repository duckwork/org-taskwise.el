#+Title: taskwise

* why?

I do a lot of writing at my job.  I organize the different articles and blogs I
write by using tasks, but within those tasks I still have headers and such.  So
just narrowing to subtree, clocking in, or marking something as done is just
... weird when I'm deep within an article and want to do those things.

This package attempts to mitigate some of those issues by adding functions to
act on task headings only.  This is like, very alpha.
